# CV and Motivation Letter template :page_facing_up:

My CV and motivation letter built with some tools I work confidently with:
- HTML (and JSX),
- CSS (and Stylus),
- JavaScript (and React)


## Quick start

To run this project, first clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bence-toth/cv-and-motivation-letter.git
```

Then in the project folder first install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Finally, start the project:

```
npm start
```

This will to open the document in a browser with hot reloading enabled.

As there is a self-signed certificate, you may have to dismiss some warnings.

Once open, you can convert the document to PDF format using the print functionality of your browser (usually <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<kbd>P</kbd> on Linux/Windows or <kbd>⌘</kbd>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<kbd>P</kbd> on Mac).


## Trivia

This project was created with the purpose of getting exported in PDF format by a web browser, and nothing more. In all honesty, it was a just lot easier for me to create my CV this way than using software where I get to use my mouse more than my keyboard, and I also find the this easier to update.


## May I use this for my CV?

Of course!

Feel free to clone or fork this repository, and use it for your own CV and motivation letter, or somebody else’s. :blush:

If I saved you a few hours of work with this, or helped you land a new job (congratulations!), maybe consider buying me a cup of tea. :tea:
