# CV and Motivation Letter template :page_facing_up:

My CV and motivation letter built with some tools I work confidently with:
- HTML (and JSX),
- CSS (and Stylus),
- JavaScript (and React)


## Usage

This project was created with the unconventional purpose of getting exported in PDF format by a web browser, nothing more. With all honesty, it was a just lot easier for me to create my CV this way than using software where I get to use my mouse more than my keyboard, and I also find the end result easier to update.

Most text in the document is `contenteditable`, so you can update the content before printing without even looking at the code.

There is no `package.json` file or anything of the sort, and no build process, everything is taken care of by the browser, all internal and external dependencies are directly or indirectly referenced in `index.html`, which is the entry point for the project.

If you want to run this locally, you will need to use some static file server. I prefer [`live-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server), but anything that can give you access to the files over HTTP should do just fine.

## May I use this for my CV?

Of course!

Feel free to clone or fork this repository, and use it for your own CV and motivation letter, or somebody elseâ€™s, or turn it into a template for your favorite chicken paprikash recipe. :blush:

If I saved you a few hours of work with this, or just helped you land a new job (congratulations!), maybe consider buying me a cup of tea. :tea:


## Caveats

Just cloning the repository and opening `index.html` in your browser via `file://` will most likely fail with some spooky CORS error.
